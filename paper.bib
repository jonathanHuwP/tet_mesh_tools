abstract  ="KOBRA (KirchOff Biological Rod Algorithm) is an algorithm and software package designed to perform dynamical simulations of elongated biomolecules such as those containing alpha-helices and coiled-coils. It represents these as coarsely-discretised Kirchoff rods{,} with linear elements that can stretch{,} bend and twist independently. These rods can have anisotropic and inhomogeneous parameters and bent or twisted equilibrium structures{,} allowing for a coarse-grained parameterisation of complex biological structures. Each element is non-inertial and subject to thermal fluctuations. The speed and simplicity of the algorithm allows KOBRA rods to easily access timescales from nanoseconds to seconds. To demonstrate this functionality{,} a KOBRA rod was parameterised using data from all-atom simulations of the Ndc80 protein complex{,} and compared against these simulations and negative-stain EM images. The distribution of bend angles and principal components were highly correlated between KOBRA{,} all-atom molecular dynamics{,} and experimental data. The properties of a hinge region{,} thought to be found at an unstructured loop{,} were studied. A C++ implementation of KOBRA is available under the GNU GPLv3 free software licence."
